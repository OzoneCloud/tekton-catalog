      'When "true", delete extra files under location not found under path.

      By default extra files are not deleted.


      NOTE: this option can delete data quickly if you specify the wrong

      source/destination combination. "BE CAREFUL WHEN USING THIS OPTION!".

      contains a large number of files, it may take a long time for gsutil to

      fetch the remote metadata for sync.


      NOTE: setting this option to "true" is not compatible with replaceExistingFiles="false"
